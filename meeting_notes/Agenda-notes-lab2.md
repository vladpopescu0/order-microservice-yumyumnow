### Meeting 21/11, Group 11a Agenda and Notes

Topics:

1. Pick someone to take notes
2. Go over the agenda points, and see if there are any other suggestions
3. Go over anything that was unclear in the lab manual
4. Decide who we want to appoint to do the contact with the other 2 teams
 - Ioana can communicate with the other 11-teams
 - We can do documents, but it is easier if we meet in person 
 - Talk with the other team on adding different types of cuisines, ratings or price for each restaurant
5. Discuss what api specification software we will use
 - We can choose any of them, there are no recommendations from the TA. Flip a coin
6. Go over requirements we created + ask TA for feedback
 - The feedback is provided 1-2 days after the lab (was provided today)
7. Divide the work of our requirements
 - Split the tasks in 3 categories: users - 3 people, vendor - 2 people, admin - 1 person.   - Everyone should get 2 issues each on average for the first milestone
8. Decide on weight/milestones/sprints in GitLab issues
 - Weight is the difficulty of the task, and is decided based on the Fibonacci numbers. If the measurement is not precise, we can rearrange the weight.
 - An average weight is 3.
9. Divide the work for the creation of our domain + testing
 - We should test the code as we are writing it. We can commit something that is not tested, but should be followed by some later.
10. Make sure that everyone is able to run the project
 - Everyone is able to run the project template.
11. Schedule a next meeting ( or decide whether we will do this later via another whatsapp )
12. Possibly start working on the code
13. Extra notes:
 - Vlad is assigned to include CI/CD.
 - Two approvals per merge request.
 - Every week the dev-branch will be merged to main.
